idleserver - Idle Server Finder
https://github.com/jheiss/idleserver

= Overview =

In medium and large computing environments, particularly ones where servers
are located in remote datacenters, it is common for some servers to end up
abandoned or otherwise idle. As IT staff we'd like to be able to find these
servers and re-purpose or retire them. This project aims to build a system to
rate the idleness of servers based on a variety of metrics, allowing you to
target your efforts starting with the servers most likely to be unused.

= Setup =
