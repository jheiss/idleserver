#  YAML formatted file
--- 
#  [default value|optional value]
#  [<url>] Define the server that the data will be sent to.
server: http://idleserver.example.com
#
#  [root|<username>,<username>] Comma separated list of users that should be ignored 
#  when considering if a box is idle (like an admin).
#  Note: last cuts off usernames at 8 characters but put the full valid username here.
ignored_users: root,joeadmin
#
#  [90|<days>] Ignore logins older than the defined number of days.
login_threshold: 90
#
#  [true|false] Whether to ignore an ignored_users processes in addition to their number of logins.
#  This will ignore processes that have a higher level parent of an ignored user 
#  regardless of which user is running the process-- ignored user's that sudo or su
#  to a different user to run processes will be ignored if set to true.
ignored_users_processes_ignored: true
#
#  [false|true] Whether root processes will be recognized as a sign of server activity (only logins are ignored with ignored_users).
ignore_root_processes: false
#
#  [90|<days>] Number of days before giving a process a slightly greater idle weight.
process_threshold: 90
#
#  [none] Ignore defined processes and their children by username or use 'ALL' to ignore the process regardless of the user.
#  Note: You don't need to list the name of the child process, just the parent.
#   [<username>|ALL]:
#   - <process>
#
#  Good for company specific system management scripts that have no bearing on real system usage.
ignored_processes_and_children:

  - gmond

  - my-custom-script
#
#  [none] Ignore defined processes by username or use 'ALL' to ignore a process regardless of the user.
#  Note: ps process names are limited to 15 characters due to its use of /proc/pid/stat. You can define
#        full names below but we only take the first 15 characters.
#  Note: ps converts usernames longer than 8 characters to the UID, Solaris shortens the username to 8
#        characters.  You can define full names below. 
#   [<username>|ALL]:
